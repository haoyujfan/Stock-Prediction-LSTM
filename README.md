# Stock-Prediction-LSTM

This program uses an artificial recurrent neural network called Long Short Term Memory (LSTM) to predict the closing stock price of a corporation using the past 60 day stock price. This isn't meant to be used to give actual stock advice by any means but is rather a personal project to begin developing software that may eventually be able to give stock advice. At the moment, there are still many factors that this model doesn't yet take into account for its predictions.
